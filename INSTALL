Deployment
-------------------

  export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 #automatic cpan modules installation
  eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=/my/perl)
  perl Build.PL --install_base /my/perl
  ./Build installdeps --cpan_client 'cpan -i'
  ./Build test
  ./Build install
  ./Build webinstall #installs additional files needed for a web server

A file with database credentials should be in .npg directory, which should be located in the user's home directory. If the $HOME variable is not set in the shell, the npg directory migh tbe located in the directory where the code is running. The name of the file should be npg_tracking-Schema; it should have content similar to the following:

dbhost=localhost
dbport=3306
dbuser=root
dbpass=
dbname=npgt

Dev web server setup
--------------------

In you git checkout, before deploying the code

edit data/config.ini to include credentials for a dev database by adding a section like this:

[dev]
dbhost=localhost
dbport=3306
dbuser=root
dbpass=
dbname=npgt

This file has to be copied manually to the deployment area.
Edit files in wtsi_local to suit your Apache server setup.
