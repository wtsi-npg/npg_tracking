Deployment
-------------------

  export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 #automatic cpan modules installation
  eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=/my/perl)
  perl Build.PL --install_base /my/perl
  ./Build installdeps --cpan_client 'cpan -i'
  ./Build test
  ./Build install
  ./Build webinstall #installs additional files needed for a web server

A file with database credentials should be in .npg directory, which should be located in the user's home directory. If the $HOME variable is not set in the shell, the npg directory migh tbe located in the directory where the code is running. The name of the file should be npg_tracking-Schema; it should have content similar to the following:

dbhost=localhost
dbport=3306
dbuser=root
dbpass=
dbname=npgt

Dev web server setup
--------------------

In you git checkout, before deploying the code

edit data/config.ini to include credentials for a dev database by adding a section like this:

[dev]
dbhost=localhost
dbport=3306
dbuser=root
dbpass=
dbname=npgt

edit data/httpd.conf - set correct paths, locations of libraries and the port number
follow the instructions in the file on commenting/uncommenting lines

The following two files are not copied by the deployment procedure, have to be copied manually

  cp data/config.ini /my/perl/data/config.ini

export PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin
unset PERL5LIB

export APACHE_ENVVARS=/nfs/users/nfs_m/mg8/working/www-dev/npg-sites/wtsi_local/envvars; /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -f $(dirname $(readlink -f $A
PACHE_ENVVARS))/apache2.conf -k start
