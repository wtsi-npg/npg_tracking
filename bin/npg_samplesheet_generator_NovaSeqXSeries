npg_samplesheet_generator_NovaSeqXSeries

=head1 USAGE

  npg_samplesheet_generator_NovaSeqXSeries [options]

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head1 OPTIONS

  C<help>     - displays help message and exists

  C<varcall>  - variant calling mode, defaults to C<None>, other valid options
                C<SmallVariantCaller> and C<AllVariantCallers>
  
  C<batch_id> - LIMS batch identifier, optional

  C<id_run>   - NPG run ID, optional; if supplied, the record for this run
                should exists in the run tracking database
  C<align>    - a boolean option, false by default; if set, the DRAGEN
                germline analysis section is added to the file if suitable
                samples are present
  C<keep_fastq> - an option to keep FASTQ files for aligned data, false
                  default
  C<dragen_max_number_of_configs> - DRAGEN analysis can deal with a limited
                  number of distinct configurations. Set this attribute if
                  processing not on-board.
