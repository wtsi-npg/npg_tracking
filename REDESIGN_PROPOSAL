CATEGORY: DEPLOYMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT: 
consistent and predictable location of db credentials and other config options
(per app config files)
INFO: clearpress apps - data/config.ini - dependency on the location of the deployed code
      dbix apps - .npg - dependency on home dirs
TASK: consider options for config files location and a reliable way of propagating this
      location to scripts and modules
      if any decision is reached, further task might be added
( urgency: urgent,
  time estimate: 1 day
  status: COMPLETED
  details: all implementation SOPS use files in .npg as a master copy and either link to
    these files or copy them
)

)

REQUIREMENT
manual qc should be possible on lanes that have no status (current status undefined)

Fix 'Error when logging manual qc action: DBIx::Class::Schema::txn_do(): Can't call method "update_run_lane_status" on an undefined value at /nfs/users/nfs_m/mg8/working/npg-catalyst-qc/trunk/npg_qc_viewer/script/../lib/npg_qc_viewer/Model/NpgDB.pm line 263'

CATEGORY: RUN AND INSTRUMENT TRACKING
-----------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
improve/amend instrument poller
TASK: RT#203939: Automatic instrument runfolder deletion
      see also RT#180080: trawl for and remove old folders from instrument disks
TASK: RT#211772: npg-tracking - improve instrument polling robustness
TASK: RT#212302: npg Monitor - cleanup (wishlist)
TASK: use winshare instead of ftp
      have both working for a while
TASK: remove access to the tracking web server (to get runfolder name);
      move logic for inferring runfolder name either to a DBIc model or
      to the poller itself;
TASK: prevent a deadlock when no runfolder name is stored on the db, the
      run is created yesterday, and started today;

REQUIREMENT:
need to know the actual length of each read (many reads these days)
TASK: #196314: npg tracking: back populate reads in NPG tracking with cycle count info
      also see RT#159038: Track reads for runs


REQUIREMENT: improve/amend staging monitor
TASK: RT#166131: CIF integrity check for mirror complete


REQUIREMENT: 
TASK: RT#191887: npg tracking - allow team117 to continue if NPG tracking is unavailable

REQUIREMENT:
both staging and instrument tracking should cope with $ENV{dev} value not being set
$ENV{dev} should not be used to control the flow of the production code, it's for
database access and resolving urls
TASK: review the use of $ENV{dev}, try creating a full test case against dev or test database

SUGGESTION: NPG is rather picky about kit version number as in 130115_MS5_9164_A_MS2003607-300v2 - expects capital V. Probably, have to be capitalised on saving to teh database

REQUIREMENT:

REQUIREMENT:
decouple the analysis pipeline from the tracking web server and the reference repository
to allow for a stand-alone lane-based pipeline
TASK: extend staging monitor to pick up run and lane statuses from runfolder files
      change pipeline jobs that update status to create relevant files
      remove xml post status update(?)
      delegate moving runfolder from analysis to outgoing to the staging monitor (?)
( time estimate: up to 10 working days
  urgency: medium
)
TASK: create abstract lims interface to query all lims and reference-related info
      data stored as extended illumina spreadsheet
      three implementations to infer the data: from psd xml feeds, from the warehouse and from the
      illumina spreadsheets
      ensure st::api::lims and caching works with the new inplementation

)
RELATED TASK: pipeline daemon to track runfolders rather than id runs and to kick off the pipeline
               script with an explicit runfolder path that should be propagated by the pipeline to
               all jobs
              pipelien analysi sdaemon might be replaced by an expended staging daemon

          and diable earlier stages status when the run is in analysis
