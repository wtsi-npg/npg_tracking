CATEGORY: TESTS IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
tests should cover the whole of run lifecycle, including user interaction

TASK: set up Selenium http://seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/
( urgency: urgent
  time estimate: ??
)

)
TASK: test should set up their own webserver if they need one
( urgency: none
)

CATEGORY: DEPLOYMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT: 
consistent and predictable location of db credentials and other config options
(per app config files)
INFO: clearpress apps - data/config.ini - dependency on the location of the deployed code
      dbix apps - .npg - dependency on home dirs
TASK: consider options for config files location and a reliable way of propagating this
      location to scripts and modules
      if any decision is reached, further task might be added
( urgency: urgent,
  time estimate: 1 day
)


REQUIREMENT:
easier branching and merging
TASK: use git for version control

  roles::run::runfolder_location -> npg_tracking::illumina::runfolder::location
  run::folder_validation -> npg_tracking::illumina::runfolder::validation
  roles::run       -> npg_tracking::gloss::run

  roles::run::lane::tag not tracked - to lims?
  roles::run::path_info -> npg_tracking::illumina::runfolder::path_info
  roles::run::log_info  -> npg_tracking::illumina::runfolder::log_info
  sequence::reference -> npg_tracking::reference_data
  
  replace npg_common::roles::log with Log4Perl
  do not use npg_common::pod_usage


REQUIREMENT:
tracking web app should run on a number of hosts: vm Ubuntu precise, sfweb

TASK: point npg::api to sfweb instance
( time estimate: ??
  urgency: moderate
  depends on: TASK(atomic deployment),
)


CATEGORY: REDESIGN OF MODELS
----------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
reduce maintenance overhead for npg models
SOLUTION:
have one type of models - DBIx;
DBIx models are auto-generated; capable of supporting relatively complex queries out of the box;
have good DBIx models
TASK: npg_tracking::Schema::Result existing models refactoring
      see also RT#187545: Use a transaction to update run_status
               RT#188218: Shared methods in npg_tracking::Schema::Result::*
               RT#190956: dbix binding for npg tracking annotation table: graceful handling of dates
               RT#191566: dbix schema auto generation: incorrect handling og on delete, on update, etc

( time estimate: ??,
  urgency: urgent,
  depends on: TASK(set-up Selenium)
)

REQUIREMENT:
model-level status rules
TASK: move instrument status graph to db
( time estimate: 3 days,
  urgency: moderate,
  depends on: TASK(npg::model backend - replace Clearpress models by  DBIx models)
)
TASK: model-level run status rules; some status updates only allowed before run complete 
( time estimate:
  urgency: moderate,
)

TASK: RT#191884: Ensure NPG tracking works with MySQL in strict SQL mode.
( time estimate: ??,
  urgency: medium,
  dependencies: none
)


CATEGORY: RUN AND INSTRUMENT TRACKING
-----------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT:
improve/amend instrument poller
TASK: RT#203939: Automatic instrument runfolder deletion
      see also RT#180080: trawl for and remove old folders from instrument disks
TASK: RT#211772: npg-tracking - improve instrument polling robustness
TASK: RT#212302: npg Monitor - cleanup (wishlist)
TASK: use winshare instead of ftp
      have both working for a while
TASK: remove access to the tracking web server (to get runfolder name);
      move logic for inferring runfolder name either to a DBIc model or
      to the poller itself;
TASK: prevent a deadlock when no runfolder name is stored on the db, the
      run is created yesterday, and started today;

REQUIREMENT:
need to know the actual length of each read (many reads these days)
TASK: #196314: npg tracking: back populate reads in NPG tracking with cycle count info
      also see RT#159038: Track reads for runs


REQUIREMENT: improve/amend staging monitor
TASK: RT#166131: CIF integrity check for mirror complete


REQUIREMENT: 
TASK: RT#191887: npg tracking - allow team117 to continue if NPG tracking is unavailable

REQUIREMENT:
both staging and instrument tracking should cope with $ENV{dev} value not being set
$ENV{dev} should not be used to control the flow of the production code, it's for
database access and resolving urls
TASK: review the use of $ENV{dev}, try creating a full test case against dev or test database

SUGGESTION: NPG is rather picky about kit version number as in 130115_MS5_9164_A_MS2003607-300v2 - expects capital V. Probably, have to be capitalised on saving to teh database


CATEGORY: PIPELINE INTERACTION
------------------------------   

REQUIREMENT:
the staging monitor, instrument poller and the analysis pipeline to support default
Illumina runfolder names to enable tracking of a variety of instruments and processing
third party runfolders
SOLUTION:
id_run should be optional in the runfolder name
TASK: remove id_run validation in short info and similar modules


REQUIREMENT:
decouple the analysis pipeline from the tracking web server and the reference repository
to allow for a stand-alone lane-based pipeline
TASK: extend staging monitor to pick up run and lane statuses from runfolder files
      change pipeline jobs that update status to create relevant files
      remove xml post status update(?)
      delegate moving runfolder from analysis to outgoing to the staging monitor (?)
( time estimate: up to 10 working days
  urgency: medium
)
TASK: create abstract lims interface to query all lims and reference-related info
      data stored as extended illumina spreadsheet
      three implementations to infer the data: from psd xml feeds, from the warehouse and from the
      illumina spreadsheets
      ensure st::api::lims and caching works with the new inplementation
( time estimate: 3 weeks?
  urgency: medium
)
TASK: two modes for reference finder - live and from cached info through this interface
      also see RT#186087: reference override ability from a config file
               RT#241842: reference finder redesign
( time estimate: 1 weeks
  urgency: medium
  depends on: TASK(create abstract lims interface)
)
RELATED TASK: pipeline daemon to track runfolders rather than id runs and to kick off the pipeline
               script with an explicit runfolder path that should be propagated by the pipeline to
               all jobs
              pipelien analysi sdaemon might be replaced by an expended staging daemon
RELATED TASK: analysis and autoqc should be able to use arbitrary ids instead if id_run? - not sure
RELATED TASK: autoqc jobs to take file names

TASK: run status on last lane past this status
( time estimate: 1 week
  urgency: medium
  depends on: TASK(extend staging monitor to pick up run and lane statuses)

          and diable earlier stages status when the run is in analysis
TASK: reorder listing of statuses on run page
      reorder and filter drop-down menu for run status change
( time estimate: 4 days,
  urgency: urgent, 
  depends on: TASK(model-level run status rules)
)

REQUIREMENT: 
correct role-based permissions in the tracking web apps (admin should not be able to do all)
TASK: find out whether magical powers of admin are hardcoded in clearpress
      if yes - can this be remedied?
      map existing web forms to user roles, consult teamsA-C,R&D if needed
      revise the code (models, views, templates)
      decide the level on which permissions will be enforced (views only?)
      change the code
      create Selenium tests
