=head1 NAME

npg_tracking::illumina::run::short_info

=head1 VERSION

$LastChangedRevision: 16549 $

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Mypackage;
  use Moose;
  with q{npg_tracking::illumina::run::short_info};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides 4 methods for your Moose class object, id_run, name, run_folder and short_reference.

You need to either always provide run_folder on construction, or provide a _build_run_folder method in your class.
Failure to do this WILL cause a run_time error. The error will be along the lines of

  Mypackage does not support builder method '_build_run_folder' for attribute 'run_folder'

It is probably worth wrapping calls in an eval block to trap any croaks which will happen should information
be needed to work out something not provided be missing, or that there may be multiple paths to a run_folder
discovered.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 id_run - can be set in the constructor, or called assuming that name or run_folder was provided

  my $oPackage = Mypackage->new({
    id_run => $id_run, # 1234
  });

  my $iIdRun = $oPackage->id_run();

=head2 name - can be set in the constructor, or called assuming that id_run or run_folder was provided

  my $oPackage = Mypackage->new({
    name => $name, # ILx_1234
  });

  my $sName = $oPackage->name();

=head2 run_folder - can be set in the constructor, or else you need to provide a _build_run_folder method. Failure to provide these WILL cause a run-time error
Constrained to not contain file-system path - anything which looks like such a path will be coerced to the last component of the path.

  my $oPackage = Mypackage->new({
    run_folder => $run_folder, # 123456_ILx_1234
  });

  my $sRunFolder = $oPackage->run_folder();

=head2 short_reference - returns the first it finds from run_folder, id_run, name

  my $ShortReference = $oPackage->short_reference();

=head2 instrument_string

returns the name of the instrument found

  my $sInstrumentString = Mypackage->instrument_string();
