=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyPackage;
  use Moose;
  with qw{npg_tracking::illumina::run::short_info
          npg_tracking::illumina::run::folder::location};

  my $oPackage = MyPackage->new({
    path => q{/string/to/a/run_folder},
  });

  my $oPackage = MyPackage->new({
    subpath => q{/string/to/a/run_folder/dir/below/it},
  });

  my $oPackage = MyPackage->new({
    path          => q{/string/to/a/run_folder},
    analysis_path => q{/recalibrated/directory/below/run_folder},
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package needs to have something provide the short_reference method, either declared in your class,
or because you have previously declared with npg_tracking::illumina::run::short_info, which is the preferred
option. If you declare short_reference manually, then it must return a string where the last digits are
the id_run.

Failure to have provided a short_reference method WILL cause a run_time error if your class needs to obtain
any paths where a path or subpath was not given in object construction (i.e. it wants to try to use id_run
to glob for it). The error will be along the lines of:

First, using this role will allow you to add a subpath to your constructor. This must be a directory
below the run_folder directory, but expressing the full path.

In addition to this, you can add an analysis_path, which is the path to the recalibrated directory,
which will be used to construct other paths from
