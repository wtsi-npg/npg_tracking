=head1 NAME

npg_tracking::report::events

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 npg_tracking::report::events->new()->process();
 npg_tracking::report::events->new(dry_run => 1)->process();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

 Attempts to report the events that have not been yet been reported
 and marks events as reported if successful. A number of different
 reports for different recipients can be generated for the same event.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 dry_run

 A boolean flag. Set it to avoid sending out reports or marking events
 as reported.

=head2 schema_npg

 DBIx handle for NPG tracking database, see npg_tracking::Schema.
 This attribute will be built if not set.

=head2 schema_mlwh

 DBIx handle for a warehouse containing LIMs data, see
 C<WTSI::DNAP::Warehouse::Schema>. This attribute will be built if not set.
 
 For ease of testing this attribute can explicitly be set to undefined,
 in which case its value will not be propagated to individual reporter modules.

=head2 process

 Retrieves unprocessed events from the database, attempts to process them
 and mark them as reported. It is tolerant to errors in processing individual
 events. It is ignorant about where errors in reporting occured and whether
 some of the reports for an event that is not marked as reported were actually
 sent.
