=head1 NAME

npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component::illumina

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Serializable component definition for an Illumina sequencing data - a lane,
lanelet or part of either of them. Defines a set of necessary and sufficient
metadata identifying data from a single Illumina sequencing run on a single
sample or library.

The required attributes are
  (1) id_run, identifying an Illumina run and, implicitly, a flowcell,
  (2) position, identifying the lane of the flowcell.
The optional attributes are
  (1) tag_index, identifying a tag sequence (barcode) that was attached
    to a library (sample) to facilitate its separation during
    analysis from other libraries (samples),
  (2) subset, identifying sequencing reads that, formally speaking,
    belong to a sample, but practically might not be wanted in the final
    data. Example: a bacterial sample from human blood might contain a
    considerable proportion of human DNA, which ends up being sequenced
    alogside the bacterial DNA. During the analysis the bacterial
    and human DNA can be separated by alignment. The human reads are
    described by the same metadata as the 'target' sample, a subset
    attrubute with value 'human' is added. The data before the separation
    is described by the same metadata as 'target' data, a 'subset' attribute
    is set to the value 'all'.
  (3) chunk, identifying where the data has been broken down into chunks to
    improve parallelism.
