=head1 NAME

Monitor::Staging - interrogate the staging area of an Illumina
short read sequencer.

=head1 VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    C<<use Monitor::Staging;
       my $stage_poll = Monitor::Staging->new();>>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class gets various bits of information from the staging area for a short
read sequencer (GA-II and HiSeq).

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 validate_areas

Check if the parameters passed to the method are valid staging areas. They
may be passed as absolute paths or as integer indices of some (hard-coded)
external array.

=head2 find_live

Take a staging area path as a required argument and return a list of all run
directories (no tests or repeats) found in incoming and analysis folders below it. I.e.
they match /staging_area/machine/{incoming, analysis}/run_folder
